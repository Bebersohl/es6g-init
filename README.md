# Javascript ES6 Gulp Init Package for Prototyping

An init package *(you could view it as an boilerplate, but that would be an over-simplification)* to get you up and running **fast** with a clean environment to prototype with javascript.

It's meant to build simple code / figuring out how things work as opposed to building web applications (although it features a web server for all your in-browser needs).

## Tell

## Tech stack

### Gulp

Task runner and orchestrator (well, there's npm...) of various services (transpiling, http server, file watcher, ...).

More info: [gulpjs.com](http://gulpjs.com/)

## Requirements

- **Node.js** - Either node version works [`4.x`](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) or [`6.x`](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/), but the `4.x` version will spit out an excessive amount of warnings (some packages are only maintained for node `6.x`+).
- **Git** - Either version is fine for this project, but if you can trick your package manager into installing the [latest](https://git-scm.com/downloads) one, that would be super.

## Roadmap

- Generator -> should generate all required files and link them in package.json
- Generator -> should be interactive
